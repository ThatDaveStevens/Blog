# Online collaboration - the need for greater intelligence

## The new normal
It's fair to say that home working and remove collaboration are now a standard working practice.  From banking call centres enabling their teams to work from home, to large innovation workshops have all moved online.   I can't recall such a dramatic shift in the change in the methods of working in my lifetime.   Like many people I've seen invites to many different platforms over the past 6 months; platforms or solutions to allow either video conferencing or online collaboration; it's been the online collaboration combined with the video conferencing where I've seen the biggest gains in the value and speed by which the output is created.
