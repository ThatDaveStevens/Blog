# Personas of a customer engagement

Recently we took a decision to change how to position the Digital Explorer platform to our users, no longer talking about it's benefit for a given job title, but instead focusing on the outcome the user wishes to achieve.    In essence the Persona.

we then mapped the Personas against a customer journey, using a [Wardley Map](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) to give a viewpoint on value and direction of travel.
