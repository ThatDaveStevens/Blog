Opensea
easy to create and add to your collection
selling created some high miner fees from 0.02 to 0.08 ($45-$140 at the time)

Rarible
had to validate/pay to create the item before selling
again similar costs to upload and mint - miner fee at 0.02


both failed, as although I had the credit within my coinbase wallet the app said I didn't have enough - emailed support on both sites.
